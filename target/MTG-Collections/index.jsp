                <h2>Welcome to MTG-Collections</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this site is to allow Magic players access and manage their personal collection. The idea of the site
                    came to me was whenever I wanted to build a deck or trade for other cards, I'd be able to go to the site and see what I needed instead
                    of guessing if I had the cards in my collection at home.
